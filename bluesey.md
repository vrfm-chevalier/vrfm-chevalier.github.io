# The Apex Rolex Bluesy
## The solid gold Rolex Submariner Date 1680/8 Blue Dial

### 1969 to 1979

After half a century of continuous production, the solid gold Submariner Date remains the most iconic of the precious metal Rolex sport watches. It's nickname, The Bluesy has in recent years been coopted by the younger and more affordable two-tone, blue dial Submariner Date. For ardent admirers of the gold Sub, the OG Bluesy remains the 1680/8.

The original reference 1680/8 is the most prized by informed collectors. It is valued for being the first and for being rare. It was offered in two dial colors - Blue and Black, with gold text and dial furniture. These are the original and highly sought after nipple dials.

The blue dial suffered pigmentation problems and ages less gracefully than the black. Meaning, they degraded to various colors from purple to brown. This color spectrum includes vivid green to orange. These have come to be known as the Tropical Dials. Despite this paint defect, tropical dials command a price premium over the matte black dial versions. Taste and preference for tropical dials is highly subjective - What is beautiful to one collector is trash to the next.

This combination of aesthetic subjectivity and high prices make the market for the Bluesy smaller and less liquid. Dealers will acknowledge these are slow to sell and afford thinner margins. Especially compared to the stainless steel 1680.

The 1680/8 is a reference for self-assured, and wealthy collectors. It is not a reference for the collector that needs validation from social media, or the reassurances of an AD. Owners of the 1680/8 belong to a privileged fraternity of largely older and more experienced collectors.

The first batch of blue dials from around 1969 to 1972, tend to age to a deep, matte purple. These are usually meters-first dials. From around 1973 to 1977, it is more common to see a deep navy blue. The jury is still out on the question of whether they just need more time to age, or if the paint formulation was changed.

A third batch of revised dials were used until the 1680/8 was discontinued in 1978. Rolex employed dials planned for the new reference 16808, in the hope the pigment was more stable. They were wrong. These developed the tropical earth colors ranging from brown to orange. These tropical dials are more commonly seen in the 16808, and finding them in the earlier 1680/8 is rare, making them highly prized.

Over the 10 year production run, three blue dial variants appear to have been deployed. The earliest were the meters-first, with a matte blue finish. The last was feet-first with a sunburst glossy blue finish. Somewhere in between exists a feet-first matte blue dial. All three are rare in their original, un-corroded state.

The key to collecting any of the blue dials is to find examples with consistent even coloring across the entire dial. Where there is color variation, it wants to be symmetrical, uniform and most importantly attractive.

Spots, chips, flakes, cracks, bubbles, blemishes and other defects should be avoided. Ignore the creative and poetic descriptions so loved by sellers. 

Paint corrosion is a slow ongoing process that will produce flakes and debris. This will eventually drag beneath the hands and scratch what remains adhered to the dial. Debris will accelerate deterioration and will eventually enter the movement as dust. Combined with lubricants, it becomes an abrasive, gritty paste.

In the 1970s organic (non-synthetic) lubricating oils were standard. Desiccated organic lubricant is hard to remove during cleaning, and made worse when combined with paint and varnish dust.

Attractive tropical dials will continue to evolve (unless stabilized) and can have unexpected and expensive consequences. As such, many collectors of the 1680/8 Bluesy favor a blue service dial over an attractively distressed original. Others will buy what they like, and argue originality trumps everything.
