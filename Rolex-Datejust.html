          The <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/icky-fox.appspot.com/60f76af3ed54c769eab28cff.pdf">Rolex Datejust</a> is a classic and iconic wristwatch that has been in production since 1945. It is known for its timeless design, durability, and precision.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Datejust is available in a variety of materials, including stainless steel, yellow gold, white gold, and rose gold. It features a round case with a diameter ranging from 31mm to 41mm, depending on the model. The watch is typically fitted with a fluted bezel, which is a hallmark feature of the Datejust. Rare exotic bezels include polished, engine turned, jeweled. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The dial of the Datejust is available in a range of colors and styles, including black, silver, and champagne. It is fitted with luminous hour markers and hands, as well as a date window at the 3 o'clock position. The date window is magnified by a Cyclops lens, which is another distinctive feature of the Datejust.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some of the more notable versions of the Datejust include the Datejust 36, which has a 36mm case, and the Datejust 41, which has a 41mm case. Other variations include the Datejust II, which has a larger case and more modern design, and the Datejust Lady, which is specifically designed for women.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to these models, Rolex has also released numerous special editions of the Datejust, such as the Datejust Pearlmaster, which is made of gold and features diamonds on the bezel and dial, and the Datejust Turn-O-Graph, which features a rotating bezel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Datejust is powered by a mechanical movement, which can be either an automatic or a manual winding caliber. Automatic calibers are self-winding and do not require manual winding, while manual winding calibers must be wound by hand. The Datejust is also available with a quickset function, which allows the wearer to quickly and easily adjust the date.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rolex has used a <a href="https://app.vrfm.io/calibers.html">variety of different movement calibers</a> in the Datejust. The specific caliber used in a particular Datejust watch will depend on the model and the production year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the movement calibers that have been used in the Rolex Datejust include:

            <a href="Scans/CALIBER-3135-3155-3175-3185-TECHNICAL-INFORMATION.pdf">Caliber 3135:</a> This is a modern automatic caliber  which features a date function, a high beat rate, and a power reserve of approximately 48 hours. It has been in production since the late 1980s and is still used in some Datejust models today.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Manual winding calibers:
        </h2>        
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            Caliber 1065: This was a manual winding caliber used in the Datejust, produced from the 1950s to the 1960s.

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In addition to these Rolex has also used other movements in the Datejust, such as the quartz caliber 5035, which was used in some Datejust models in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Datejust is fitted with a bracelet that is either a three-link Oyster or a five-link Jubilee, depending on the model. The Oyster bracelet is made of stainless steel and features a folding Oysterlock clasp, while the Jubilee bracelet is made of gold or stainless steel and features a deployant clasp.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the Rolex Datejust is a classic and sophisticated watch that is suitable for both formal and casual occasions. It is a reliable, waterproof, and durable timepiece that is sure to become a treasured heirloom.
