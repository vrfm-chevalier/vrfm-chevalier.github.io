      <div class="container text-left p-5">

        <p class="lead">Collectors of the GMT-Master are some of the nerdiest and detail-obsessed of all vintage Rolex
          enthusiasts. Many subtle design variations were introduced over the years, making this reference enjoyable to
          learn about but challenging to collect. This is a heady mix for collectors, and the solid gold editions are
          holy-grail additions to their collections</p>

        <p>The GMT-Master is an undeniably cool watch. Its image is associated with a golden era of international travel
          and adventure. Vintage examples in precious metals are romantic, nostalgic heirlooms, stores of wealth, and
          sources of great pride for many owners. Many of whom come to find one is simply not enough!</p>

        <p>The solid gold GMT-Master debuted in 1954, with reference 6542, the first GMT. This is an extremely rare
          reference, and in solid gold even more so. The gold 6542/8 is beyond all but the most elite collectors and
          while they occasionally appear at auction, they are more likely to change hands privately (for the cost a
          modest family home).</p>

        <p>The 6542/8 was followed by the slightly more common solid gold 1675/8 in 1960. These can be more easily
          found, and for more reasonable money (for the cost of a modest family car).</p>

        <p>The 1960's was an exciting time, and Rolex advertising rode the economic, technological, and cultural tide to
          boost visibility of the GMT-Master. The solid gold GMT-Master sold well, against the gold Submariner,
          benefiting from advertising associations with pilots of the 747 and Concord.</p>

        <figure style="width: 10rem; float:right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">
          <img loading="lazy" src="img/GmtvsSub.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid"
            alt="Vintage GMT-Master vs Submariner">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">1675/8 vs 1680/8. Both examples from 1977 feature gold nipple dials,
            applied Rolex coronets, gilt text and minute track, and acrylic crystals. These characteristics are unique
            to the era and much loved by collectors.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>It is a curious fact that prices for solid gold vintage GMT's are generally lower than those of the <a
            href="/gold-submariners">solid gold Submariner of the same era</a>. The GMT-Master is a more advanced
          timepiece, with its fourth hand and 24-hour complication. It has a slimmer case profile and wears more
          comfortably on most wrists. It was offered on more bracelet options (plus leather) and was more aggressively
          advertised. There is a solid argument for it being the sexier watch on all fronts; and yet the gold Submariner
          commands a price premium.</p>

        <p>Either the Sub is over valued or the GMT-Master is undervalued, offering a better buying and investment
          opportunity.</p>

        <p>Throughout the 1960's and 70's the gold GMT-Master appears to have been a bigger commercial success,
          outselling the gold Sub. To what extent, nobody knows for sure but examples offered for sale online
          consistently outnumber the Sub by a modest margin (when comparing references of similar age).</p>

        <p>At the time of writing, Chrono24 is offering <a
            href="https://www.chrono24.com/search/index.htm?caseMaterials=3&currencyId=USD&dosearch=true&facets=referenceNumber&manufacturerIds=221&maxAgeInDays=0&models=3&pageSize=60&redirectToSearchIndex=true&referenceNumber=1675%24221&resultview=block&sortorder=0">40
            examples of the 1675/8</a> versus <a
            href="https://www.chrono24.com/search/index.htm?caseMaterials=3&currencyId=USD&dosearch=true&facets=referenceNumber&manufacturerIds=221&maxAgeInDays=0&models=1&pageSize=60&redirectToSearchIndex=true&referenceNumber=1680%24221&resultview=block&sortorder=0">26
            examples of the equivalent Submariner 1680/8</a>. While not authoritative, this imbalance is representative
          of what can be found on most watch forums.</p>

        <p>Many collectors of vintage watches of this era, agree the gold GMT-Master is a classier, more sophisticated,
          and versatile choice than the bruiser that is the gold Submariner. Some of this has to do with comfort and
          wearability (slimmer cases and Jubilee bracelets). Some of it has to do with black and brown dials being more
          versatile than <a href="https://www.vrfm.io/gold-submariners">blue and purple (or even orange)</a>.</p>

        <p>This article will help you understand the subtle details that make the solid gold GMT so desirable, and will
          equip you with what you need to know to buy a <em>vintage</em> one.</p>

        <h2>Lets Talk Gold Content</h2>

        <p>Made of 18 karat gold, the GMT-Master is 75% pure gold. The remaining 25% is a combination of silver, copper,
          platinum or palladium (depending on the reference). These additional precious metals were added to form a
          tougher, more durable gold alloy and the exact composition of the gold alloy has evolved over the half
          century. Today Rolex operates its own foundry and invests heavily in developing proprietary alloys.</p>

        <p>The early vintage GMT-Master cases were made by partners like Genex SA, the case-making department of Gay
          Frères, the famed bracelet maker. Winding crowns were made by Boninchi and both case and crown would have been
          hand-finished by Virex et Joli Poli. These companies were acquired in the late 1990's while Patrick Heiniger
          was at the helm of Rolex.

        </p> The exact weight of a gold GMT-Master varies slightly between references, as dimensions and design details
        evolved. The gold components include the Oyster mid-case, caseback, winding crown, bezel ring, hands, dial
        markers, spring bars, bracelet and clasp. The weight of these parts is approximately 185 grams. <p>

          <div class="text-center">

            <p class="lead"> So, 185 grams x 75% = 138.75 grams of pure gold.</p>

            <p class="lead">At the time of writing, the spot price of gold is about US$57 per gram.</p>

            <p class="lead">So an estimated gold value of 138.75 grams x $57 = $7908.75.</p>

        <h2>So How Many Models To Choose From?</h2>

        <p class="lead">If we're looking for a <em>vintage</em> piece there are three GMT-Master references to choose
          from - the 6542/8, 1675/8 and 16758. We'll exclude the GMT-Master II and the modern-classic 16718, and
          subsequent 116718. </p>

        <p>The gold 6542 (cal 1065) was only offered with a brown dial. The gold 1675 (cal 1565, 1576) and gold 16758
          (cal 3075) were offered in black or brown. So five models, using four movements, spanning 40 years of
          production. This narrows things down considerably.

        <p class="lead">The main difference between the outgoing GMT-Master (16758) and incoming the GMT-Master II
          (16718) is the adoption of the movement cal. 3085 in the 1980's.</p>

        <p>In addition to technical enhancements, the main marketable functional advances were the quickset date and GMT
          hand. The GMT-Master II is not generally considered <em>vintage</em> but rather neo or modern-classic. These
          5-digit references are transitional in the sense they retain many vintage characteristics, and are visually
          distinct from the contemporary GMT-Master II like the 116718LN.</p>

        <p>If you are not a fan of the iconic nipple dial then the more contemporary GMT-Master II is for you. These
          later models are generally more abundant, in better condition, and command lower prices.</p>

        <p>It is important to understand Rolex production processes evolved rapidly from the late 1990's onwards.
          Process automation and quality control became more sophisticated resulting in a more uniform product. This
          high level of engineering is very apparent in the look and feel of modern references.</p>

        <p>Vintage watches by comparison show far more variation in their finishing, and gold cases were meticulously
          hand polished. Small variations can be seen between watches of the same batch (close serial number ranges).
          Oyster cases were seldom perfectly symmetrical and the width of lug chamfers could vary. While this is also
          true of stainless steel equivalents, the effect is more pronounced with gold being softer.</p>

        <h2>The Vintage GMT-Masters In Solid 18K Gold</h2>

        <h4 class="pt-5">Reference 6542 (1954-1959) Caliber 1065</h4>
        <p>This reference was originally launched with radium lume material on the dial, hands and Bakelite bezel. This
          radioactive material was the subject of a service recall in the 1960s. Most surviving examples have had their
          dials, hands and bezels replace by Rolex with safer tritium versions. Bakelite bezels are known to be fragile
          and prone to cracking. Nearly all examples of this reference will have replacement bezels and any surviving
          original examples are generally in poor cosmetic condition. So the notion of <em>all original</em> is not
          really relevant to this reference. A buyer should focus on authenticity and aesthetic appeal.</p>

        <p>This reference has a slightly smaller 38mm case and classic alpha hands. These characteristics are so typical
          of the 1950's aesthetic.</p>

        <p>During the 20 years of production the 1675/8 experienced two notable design changes to the hands and the
          Oyster case crown guards. The anodized aluminum bezels are more durable than Bakelite and many have survived
          in good cosmetic condition.</p>

        <p>The main criticism of this reference is the slow setting date and GMT hand. Setting both involves winding the
          watch around 24 hours. While this may not be a major irritant on March 1st, it can be quite a chore if left
          unwound for several weeks.</p>

        <p>Of the three <em>vintage</em> references, this is the one that most interest collectors. Within the reference
          there is lots of design variation, prices are reasonable, and examples are plentiful in a range of conditions.
          The 1675/8 embodies the charm of a truly vintage Rolex.</p>

          functional improvements that came with the cal 3075 was the quickset date (but not the 24 hour GMT hand).</p>

        <h2>Lets Talk Dials</h2>

        <p class="lead">Dials were manufactured predominately (but not exclusively) by Bayler. Dials are held in place
          by two prongs or dial feet on the back. These slot into holes in the movement beneath. The position of the
          prongs and holes is specific to the movement. So a dial with feet positioned for caliber 1575 will not fit
          caliber 1065 or 3075. Dials are generally not interchangeable between references. However, prongs can be
          removed and reattached, or dials can be held in place with sticky dial dots. So it is possible dials can end
          up in watches they were not designed for. However, it is easy enough to swap a black dial for a brown one
          within the same reference. </p>

        <p>Generally the earlier matte-finished dials age better than the glossy sunburst variants. Both can be found in
          good original condition but the popular <em>tropical dials</em> tend to have started life as glossy sunburst
          versions. </p>

        <!-- Tropical -->

          <img loading="lazy" src="img/16758-Tropical.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Tropical">
          <div class="card-body bg-white">
            <p class="card-text text-muted font-italic"><small>Source: Hodinkee</small><br />"There's something that
              just can't be beat about a product built to last showing its age, and watches bearing tropical dials are a
              perfect and particularly desirable example of this."</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>It is true that some signs of age add character to a gold watch but be wary of descriptions used by sellers.
          What is considered desirable, attractive patina in a steel GMT-Master, does not translate well to a high-end
          sold gold GMT-Master. A heavily distressed gold watch looks tatty, where equivalent patina on a stainless
          steel GMT-Master can look cool.</p>

        <p>While unpolished gold GMTs are desirable, it is not so egregious to polish one provided the work is of a high
          standard. The line between good and bad can be thin, but the goal is to maintain as much presence and charm as
          it originally had.</p>

        <p>Use of the term <em>tropical </em>is especially common with sunburst dials. Use of the word <em>patina
          </em>is more commonly used to describe the condition of tritium lume and therefore associated with later dials
          featuring more tritium lume. Both terms are euphemisms for corrosion, which we should remember is a constant
          ongoing process. And like rust, will continue unless treated. Corrosion that may be minor (or attractive)
          today, could be catastrophically ugly in a few years.</p>

        <p>Corrosion is a natural phenomena and should not be confused with damage. Unscrupulous sellers may try to
          conflate the two. Attractive corrosion like the Tropical Dials above can command a price premium based on
          their aesthetic. Damage never does anything good for long term value.</p>

        <p>If you are considering a Tropical dial, aim for overall evenness, uniformity and consistency. Never pay a
          premium for a damaged dial caused by mishandling. Unless the rest of the watch is compelling (very
          attractively priced) move on.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-muted">There is some debate over the two-tone bezel and if it was officially sold
              on the gold GMT-Master. Some argue it was reserved for the two-tone models (the <em>Rootbeer</em>). Others
              claim to have original examples similar to this. Whatever the truth, it was introduced with the 5-digit
              references.</p>

        <h2>Bezels</h2>

        <p class="lead">While bezel inserts may seem a small thing, they are an integral part of the overall design and
          strongly influence valuation. Loose bezels in good condition sell for several thousand dollars. Replacing an
          incorrect, damaged, or fake bezel can be a time consuming and expensive project. Particularly on early
          references.</p>

        <p>Bezels were designed to be <em>consumable</em> and were often replace by Rolex during servicing. They are
          easily changed and owners do this out of personal preference. Original bezels are highly prized but rare.
          Service bezels are acceptable and common. Fake, <a
            href="https://www.esslinger.com/generic-rolex-parts-to-replace-bezel-inserts/">after-market (non-Rolex)</a>
          bezels are to be avoided. Distinguishing between them can take a trained eye and buyers should seek input from
          Rolex forums if in doubt. A full discussion of bezel variants, eras, and fakes is worthy of its own book and
          beyond the scope of this discussion. At the time of writing, <a
            href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vintagerolexforum/viewtopic.php?t=266367">this post by Xeramic on VRF
            is one of the most comprehensive analysis on the internet</a> .</p>

        <p>All versions of the GMT-Master feature a bi-directional bezel. These were friction fit (non-clicking) until
          the arrival of the modern classic reference 16718, with the 120 click bezel. It is correct for transitional
          models like the 16758 to have the older-style friction fit, non-clicking bezels.</p>

        <p>Bezel Dimensions (1675/8, 16758)
          <ul>
            <li>Outer diameter ~37.75 mm</li>
            <li>Inner diameter ~30.2 mm</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p> What we know for sure is the Black-Gold and Brown-Gold bezels are correct for the gold GMT-Master. While the
          Black-Silver is not incorrect for very early serial numbers of 1675/8, it is most likely from a stainless
          steel model. Brown-Silver is also seen on early 1675/8 references and while no catalog evidence has yet
          surfaced, the collector community consider's it legitimate. Some examples are gold faded to silver, but a few
          are clearly silver. In some circles Brown-Silver is considered rare and commands a price premium.</p>

        <h2>Oyster Case Hallmarks</h2>

        <p class="lead">Hallmarks should be present on all Rolex made of precious metals. They appear on mid-cases
          (underside of lugs), casebacks, bracelets, and clasp blades. The absence of hallmarks indicates gold cap, gold
          fill or gold plate. Mismatched hallmarks suggest a Frankenwatch assembled from various parts.</p>

        <p>Hallmarks are defined by an official Swiss government assay office and applied under license by the
          manufacturer (Rolex or Genex). There are seven assay offices in Switzerland and Rolex uses the Geneva office
          exclusively. The symbol for the Geneva assay office is a capital G, which will form part of a larger hallmark.

                <p class="card-text">A Swiss assay hallmark is exceptionally detailed, which makes it very difficult to
                  copy. It must be consistent and flawless with each stamping. The assay office controls the quality and
                  if not perfect, the item will be scrapped and cannot be sold. The crispness and detail of a hallmark
                  are essential in establishing authenticity.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Solid 18K (750) gold GMT-Masters will have the Helvetia Bust (lady’s head) with a
                  capital “G” below her neck</p>

                <p class="card-text">Current Swiss law (post-1995) has reduced the number of hallmarks to a single mark,
                  the head of a St. Bernard dog. The Office of Precious Metal Control refers to this St. Bernard dog as
                  “Barry”. It appears near the Maker’s Responsibility Mark and their indication of purity. Barry can be
                  found on the underside of lugs and on the caseback.</p>

        <p>Rolex watches imported into other countries are subject to local assay or customs office inspection and may
          carry hallmarks in addition to the Swiss ones. For example, watches imported for sale into France and England
          would have additional, but different hallmarks.</p>
